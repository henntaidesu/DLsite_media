echo Notes:
echo   - All managed dependencies (HtmlAgilityPack, NAudio, SharpCompress, Sqlite, etc.) are bundled into the single exe.
echo   - The LibVLC engine's DLLs (libvlc, libvlccore, all codec/demux plugins) are bundled into the exe too,
echo     and self-extracted to a temp cache folder the first time the app runs.
echo   - A small libvlc\win-x64 folder remains next to the exe (hrtfs spatial-audio data + lua playlist/interface
echo     scripts, a few MB total) - LibVLC needs these as real files, keep them alongside DLsiteMedia.exe.
echo   - The .NET runtime itself is NOT bundled. If the target machine lacks the .NET 10 Desktop Runtime,
echo     running DLsiteMedia.exe shows the official Windows/.NET prompt guiding the user to download and install it.
